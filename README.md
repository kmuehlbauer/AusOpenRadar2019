The course will take place on November 12th 2019, right before the Australian radar workshop. We will introduce the participants to [community software packages](http://openradarscience.org) designed for radar data processing, including (but not limited to) [BALTRAD](http://git.baltrad.eu/), [Py-ART](http://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/), and [wradlib](https://wradlib.org). Following a welcome, there will be an introduction to Open Science concepts and the Open Radar context.


The common ground for most of those tools is Python, so we'll feature a quick intro to the Python programming language, and endow participants with the basics of how to contribute to community software. The course will be deliverd using cloud based solutions like Binder and Pangeo. As a backup we will provide a [platform-independent virtual machine](http://openradarscience.org/vm-docs/) that contains all the required software, data, and course materials. 



### List of tutors
* Collis, Scott (Argonne National Laboratory, USA)
* Michelson, Daniel B. (Environment and Climate Change, Canada)
* Warren, Robert (Monash University)

### List of Contributors

* MÃ¼hlbauer, Kai (University of Bonn, Germany)
* Crisologo, Irene (Northwestern University, USA)
* Jackson, Bobby (Argonne National Laboratory, USA)
* Soderholm, Joshua (Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Australia)


### Things you need to prepare
Participants need to bring their own 64-bit notebook (Linux, Windows, Mac). All you need to do is to install VirtualBox and import the Virtual Machine for the course, this will be used as a back up if the Pangeo binder does not work. Please see [here](http://openradarscience.org/vm-docs/) for general instructions, and [here](vm-launch) for an overview specific to this course.

### Location

The course will be held in the Civil Engineering building on the Clayton Campus.

Go up the stairs, into the civil engineering department and walk most of the way down the hall... Some one will find you or you will find us :)
